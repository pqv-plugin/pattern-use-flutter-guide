# Public Network Terms of Service

By using our products, you agree to our Terms of Service.

The Stack Overflow Network is a set of related Internet sites and other applications for questions and answers \(also referred to herein as the “Network”\), owned and operated by Stack Exchange, Inc. \(“Stack Overflow”, “we” or “us”\), a Delaware corporation. Stack Overflow welcomes you to the Network, the largest community of developers in the world, and invites you to participate in the community by sharing knowledge with your peers and colleagues. Like all communities, we ask that you participate in a manner that respects your fellow community members. To that end, we provide you with these terms of service to advise you of the legal obligations you assume when you engage with the Stack Overflow community or otherwise access or use the public Network or any services provided on the public Network \(collectively, “Services”\). These terms govern the use of the public Network \(the “Public Network Terms”\).

To the extent you are accessing or using our other products on behalf of a Company or Team, including without limitation by registering for an account on behalf of a Company or Team, your use of those products \(such as Stack Overflow for Teams or Stack Overflow Business\) is governed by their relevant Terms and Conditions.
